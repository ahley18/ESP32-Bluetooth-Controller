# ESP32 Bluetooth LED Control

This project demonstrates how to control an LED connected to an ESP32 using Bluetooth commands. The ESP32 acts as a Bluetooth server, receiving commands to either blink the LED at different speeds or turn it on and off.

## Features

- **Bluetooth Communication:** The ESP32 communicates with a paired device (e.g., smartphone, laptop) using Bluetooth.
- **LED Control:** The connected LED can blink fast, blink slowly, or stay on or off based on the commands received via Bluetooth.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- LED
- 220Î© Resistor (optional, for current limiting)
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
- Bluetooth terminal app (e.g., Serial Bluetooth Terminal) for testing
